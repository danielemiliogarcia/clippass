    <p>
      Clippass is a Chrome extension designed to securely manage and decrypt passwords that have been encrypted using a PGP key.
      The extension integrates with your operating system to perform the decryption process because the PGP key and related operations
      are managed by your system and not the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main idea is to use this extension with this password manager <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">https://www.passwordstore.org/</a> using the -e feature that I added.
      See <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/danielemiliogarcia/password-store/-/merge_requests/1">This merge request</a></p>
    <p>
      To enable this functionality, the extension requires a native system host that can securely interact with the clipboard and
      decrypt the encrypted password. This native host facilitates communication between the browser and the system-level script
      responsible for decryption.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set up the native system host, you must download and run the installer provided below. This installer will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a script to your system to decrypt passwords from the clipboard.</li>
      <li>Register the native messaging host to allow communication between the extension and your system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once the native system host is installed, the extension will work seamlessly to decrypt passwords and input them securely
      into the focused field on your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>USAGE:</strong> To use it: copy your encrypted password to the clipboard (see password-store [pass] -e option), then focus the text or password field , then click the extension icon and the password will be inserted in plaintext. Do not forget to touch your yubi key if you are using one.
    <p>
      Click the "Download" button then, its a bash script, then inspect it if you want, and run it in your terminal.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The installation process requires running a script on your system. This is necessary for the
    extension's functionality and is performed securely.</p>
